# Bofur

Simple timer built using [electron](http://electron.atom.io/). Made as study and because many timers on linux looks awful.


## Why is called Bofur?

I'm terrible when I've to choose a name, so to not lose time in projects made as study I'll use the dwarves names of the Hobbit:

- [ ] Thorin
- [ ] Fili
- [ ] Kili
- [ ] Dwalin
- [ ] Oin
- [ ] Gloin
- [ ] Dori
- [ ] Nori
- [ ] Ori
- [ ] Bifur
- [x] Bofur
- [ ] Bombur
